Desire Dynamics differentiates between the direct individual experience and discussion of Self Identity and personal or role identities (Personal I's and i-Roles). The Self within Desire Dyanmics is treated as empty while the I's are treated as denoted or full, either can be consider a first cause of an attitude. 

In the case of any 'I' identity, when being considered as a, recursive, naturally arising, first cause of mental attitudes to emergent knowledge, within a human mind, Desire Dynamics treats it as a signifier from a consitent set. This means that the set to which the 'I' identity belongs will naturally resist knowledge that cannot be contained within the set, more often than not including the notion of an empty set such as Self.

In enabling Self as empty Desire Dynamics enables the inclusion of knowable knowledge that cannot be named. Essentially we may as humans know something such as those experiences we sometimes name as spiritual which cannot be defined by a naming convention. This enables an infinetly open invinsible Self identity which can adapt without guilt or shame with knowledge.

Generally when we experience ourselves most fully, in and personal idnetity we experience some combination of significence and substances. If we reflect and consider for a moment, sometime when we sincerely said, something like, 'I love (hate) you' to somebody, we have most likely felt strong emotions of attachment or repulsion, coupled with physically descernable viseral experiences that convince us to believe, that what we refer to is an internally substantial state of mind. When in a learnign environment our teacher or lecturer tells us that a particular piece of knowledge is important it is because of the significence we give weight to what they say.

The infinite complexity of meanings that arise through the intertwining of what we experience as substantial and significent can be illustrated if we feel betrayed or helped by a colleague in a group. We often have strong yet unrefined expectations of others and of ourselves in roles and in relationship to knowledge within those roles.
