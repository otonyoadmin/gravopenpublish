**Desire Dynamics** provides a unique context for the synthetic integration of Self-conception and Personal 'I' identities.

In learning how to use the My-I Witness framework provided, each individual can
* compassionately disabuse errors is self conceptions
* intimately include new experientially discovered knowledge and reframe,
* comprehensively monitor and manage current attitudes, in roles
* purposefully collate and create more meaningful understanding of true value
* synthetically integrate for continous improvement, using the highest commmon denominator
* and skilfully adapt for positive participation

while using their own unique, knowledge determined, self-produced **Desire Profiles**.

## 1 Door 2 States

There are two states of human identification of which we may speak when using Desire Dynamics,

* the personal or identified state where we commonly use the term 'I' or 'You' to refer to ourselves or other human beings
* and a Self-state of awareness, which is essentially empty of identifications while aware.

Blindly accepting derivative 'I' and 'You', identities, based upon social Holonâ€™s and allowing them to conflate and thus hijack Self identities, naturally creates the risk of catastrophic failure, never more obvious than in the brittleness being exposed in White Male identities, during the current period of rapid social identity change.

> **In the 21st Century, economic trade will lose its primacy as the currency of human wealth, as authenticated self-knowledge reveals itself publicly as the nectar of superior human participation.**

The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) heralds a potential armada of Black Swan events on the horizon of the 21st century, events that cannot be seen by the derivative I and You. For the first time since the renaissance the essential nature of what it means to be human is about to become the central social issue, if God died with Nietzsche the naked Ego dies with the advent of AI. 

As Undergraduates and Graduates of IVY league universities, fulsomely inhabit the emblematic roles of modern social heroes, as they offer themselves as servants to trade their individual identities are systemically absorbed and their objects of desire are artfully packaged from Spring Break, to Gated Community, with time limited sojourns in Sandals, Country Clubs and fashionable Yoga Classes facilitated by the attractively svelte. 

The delusional, now derided, Self blind, 'Loads of Money', financial meritocracy which provided the social revolution that yielded the egoic workaholic dispositions of the 'I' and 'You' in the childern of the Thatcherite Reaganite revolution of the 1980's, was enbled by making Self a deriviative of a number in a bank account. Good was a positive integer, better was a larger integer bad was a negative number. We may also observe from this time how work free desires in this population of humans created all but a reenactment of the self destructive leasurtime errors witnessed in the Bright You Things of 1920's England. A wider more inclusive view of the time at the time could have freed some individual will from the group enchantment. What remains common to the 1920's and 1980's remains common to all of us today as our capacity for passionate individual commitment to the shallowest of the unrefined individual and social objects of desires infatuates our Self identity and encrusts the profundity of our human capacity and our natural capacity for joy with symbols, semephores and substances.

has morphed from the 1980's 'Loads of Money' culture to an equally distructive yet no less fashionable culture, where microdosing on Sylibsibum, LSD, MDMA and  

is burn out is commonly in this the early part of the century as the high voltage passion needed to work incessintly has the best and brightest microdosing on sylybsibum, lsd, mdma and anything they can get to improve mental accuity in the same way physical atheletes have hyped performance with steroids.
offer their egoic existences to the existing that remain invisible on the horizon similar potential catastrophic dangers for Self-identity as financial derivates contain for pension funds.

 as the most easily identified and most common state is that of the personal 'I' and 'You' states, where 'passion' most often controls the reins and whip as purpose. Whether it is the passionate pursuit of sporting victory, nationalist, race or gender fervour, the obsession of what are named addictions, the passion of romantic entanglements with other humans or objects or the pursuit of the absence of passion through techniques for removing passionate identification we all know the rough beast that is the journey through objects of desire, which rely upon time dependent identities constructed from the story our "I's" live in, which are derivatives of the cultures within which our I's were grown.  

The essential emptiness of the Self state remains, embodied, resilient and consistent throughout a life and appears manifest in a willing receptiveness in a dynamic relationship with identifications that arise and fall as 'I' and 'You'.

In many respects this self-identity is analogous of a what scientists sometimes call a black hole which is observed as present due to the absence of substance. In a human context we may observe this as disinterested awareness, which is enabled by space.
